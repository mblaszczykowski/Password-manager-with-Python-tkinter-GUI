## General Information
- The purpose of this project was for me to build clean, minimalistic user interface with tkinter, play with cryptography module and build something as useful as password manager.
- As it encrypts all informations based on your master password and stores it on your local machines, encrypted, it is very safe place for all your important notes and if you lost your master password, you will loose all of your informations as they will be just a mess of encrypted letters somewehere on your computer.
